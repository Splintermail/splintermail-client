TL;DR: Don't sue us. We won't sue you. OpenSSL/libuv restrictions apply.

This software is compiled entirely from free and open source code, for
the sake of your freedom, privacy, and piece of mind.  All source code
is available at:

- https://splintermail.com, for Splintermail itself
- https://openssl.org, for the OpenSSL library used by Splintermail
- https://libuv.org, for the libuv library used by Splintermail

Splintermail wants you to live a happy, lawsuit-free life and will not
create any restrictions to your usage and redistribution of
Splintermail software.  All Splintermail source code is released into
the public domain, under the terms of the Unlicense.

However, this binary form contains more than just Splintermail
software.  This binary form also includes software from Splintermail's
dependencies, OpenSSL and libuv.  Therefore, certain conditions of
OpenSSL's dual licenses (the OpenSSL Licence and the SSLeay License)
and libuv's license apply to the usage and redistribution of this
binary form.
