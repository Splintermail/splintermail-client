/* The TLS engine is just a raw subnode and a decrypted subnode glued together:

   Note that the TLS engine API defines the arrows going *into* the nodeÂ¸
   arrows going *out* of the node are calls to other nodes' APIs.

   Additional notes:
     - since the packets in and out of the TLS engine are very much *not*
       one-to-one, there should generally be no implicit passing of
       session references, they should all be explicit.
     - When fully multithreaded, the public API should only be adding events
       to a queue which the TLS engine will process on its own thread.
     - Errors flow down the pipe, i.e. to higher application layers
     - for invalid sessions, push operations (trying to trigger SSL_read after
       a raw read comes in, for instance) are no longer attempted.  Pull
       operations to clean out buffers might be OK.
