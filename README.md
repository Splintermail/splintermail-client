Remember that collecting data is never free, and nobody collects to help you â€” they collect to control you, whether for

We believe privacy is a right.  It is just as wrong for companies or government agencies to read your email as it is for them to follow you and record your face-to-face conversations.  The only one who should have access to your email inbox is you.  Our email service makes that possible.

# What's in this repository

The Splintermail server stores your email completely encrypted, using encryption keys generated and stored on your own device, so you are the only one who can read your email.

This repository contains the source code for the `splintermail` application, which runs on your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer to automatically handle secure generation and handling of the encryption keys.  The `splintermail` application also downloads and decrypts email, allowing you to continue using your favorite email client (Thunderbird, AppleMail, Outlook, Mutt, etc).

Finally, the `splintermail` application allows you to generate or delete new aliases (or various other account actions) from the command line or in scripts, as an alternative to the web interface at [Splintermail.com](https://splintermail.com).
